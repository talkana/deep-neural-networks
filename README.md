# Deep neural networks
This repository contains homeworks from "Deep neural networks" - a course covering the core principles of deep learning.

Homework 1 is a low-level implementation of backpropagation, optimized for memory-efficiency through the use of checkpointing.

Homework 2 implements a decoder-only transformer model in PyTorch, with caching of calculated keys and values.

Homework 3 implements Rainbow DQN, an algorithm commonly used in reinforcement learning.

Completing these assignments provided me with a deep understanding of fundamental concepts in neural networks. Feel free to use them for your own learning and exploration.
