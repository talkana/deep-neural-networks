# Deep neural networks
Homeworks from "Deep neural networks" course.

Homework 1 is a low-level implementation of backpropagation with checkpointing.

Homework 2 implements a decoder-only transformer model in PyTorch, with caching of calculated keys and values.

Homework 3 implements Rainbow DQN, commonly used in reinforcement learning.
