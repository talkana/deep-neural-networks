# Deep neural networks
Homeworks from "Deep neural networks" course.

Homework 1 is a low-level implementation of backpropagation with checkpointing.

Homework 2 implements a transformer language model. The model is trained on a toy problem and used to generate text.

Homework 3 implements improvements of DQN algorithm (Rainbow DQN), which are commonly used in reinforcement learning.
