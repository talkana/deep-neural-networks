# Deep neural networks
Homeworks from "Deep neural networks" course.

Homework 1 is a low-level implementation of backpropagation with checkpointing.

Homework 2 implements a decoder-only transformer model in Torch with caching calculated keys and values

Homework 3 implements improvements of DQN algorithm (Rainbow DQN), which are commonly used in reinforcement learning.
